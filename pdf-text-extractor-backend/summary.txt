 A deterministic inventory model is developed for deteriorating items in which shortages are allowed and partially backlogged . The model is solved analytically by minimizing the total inventory cost . Shortage is a fraction of those customers whose demand is not satisfied in the current period reacts to this by not returning the next period . Backlogging rate is variable and dependent on the length of the next replenishment .

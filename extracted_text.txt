Abstract 
 
In this paper, a deterministic inventory model is developed for deteriorating items 
in which shortages are allowed and partially backlogged. Deterioration rate is 
constant, Demand rate is linear function of time, backlogging rate is variable and 
is dependent on the length of the next replenishment. The model is solved 
analytically by minimizing the total inventory cost.

1.0 Introduction 
 
Deterioration is defined as decay, damage, spoilage evaporation and loss 
of utility of the product. Deterioration in inventory is a realistic feature and need 
to consideration it. Often we encounter products such as fruits, milk, drug, 
vegetables, and photographic films etc that have a defined period of life time. 
Such items are referred as deteriorating items. The loss due to deterioration cannot 
be avoided. Due to deterioration, inventory system faces the problem of shortages

and loss of good will or loss of profit. Shortage is a fraction of those customers 
whose demand is not satisfied in the current period reacts to this by not returning 
the next period.  
Inventory in deteriorating items first considered by Within [1957], he 
considered the deterioration of fashion goods at the end of prescribed storage 
period. In 1963 Ghare and Schrader extended the classical EOQ formula with 
exponential decay of inventory due to deterioration and gave a mathematical 
modeling of inventory in deteriorating items. Dave and Patel [1981] developed the 
first deteriorating inventory model with linear trend in demand. He considers 
demand as a linear function of time. Nahmias [1982] gave a review on perishable 
inventory theory. He reviewed the relevant literature on the problem of 
determining suitable ordering policies for both fixed life perishable inventory, and 
inventory subjected to continuous exponential decay. Rafaat [1991] gave a survey 
of literature on continuously deteriorating inventory models and he considered the 
effect of deterioration as a function of the on hand level of inventory. He focused 
to present an up-to-date and complete review of the literature for the continuously 
deteriorating mathematical inventory models. But all researchers assume that 
during shortage period all demand either backlogged or lost. In reality it is 
observed that some customers are willing to wait for the next replenishment. Abad 
[1996] considered this phenomenon in his model, optimal pricing and lot sizing 
under the conditions of perishable and partial backordering. He assumed that the 
backlogging rate depends upon the waiting time for the next replenishment. But 
he does not include the stock out cost (back order cost and lost sale cost). Chang 
and Dye [1999] developed an inventory model with time varying demand and 
partial backlogging. He considered that if longer the waiting time smaller the 
backlogging rate would be. So the proportion of the customer who would like to 
accept backlogging at time t is decreasing with the waiting time for the next 
replenishment. So to take care for this situation he defined a backlogging rate s. t.

Where 
it  is the time at which the

Goyal and Giri [2001] gave recent trends of modeling in deteriorating 
items inventory. They classified inventory models on the basis of demand 
variations and various other conditions or constraints. Ouyang, Wu and Cheng 
[2005] developed an inventory model for deteriorating items with exponential 
declining demand and partial backlogging. Dye, Hsieh and Ouyang [2007] find an 
optimal selling price and lot size with a varying rate of deterioration and 
exponential partial backlogging. They assume that a fraction of customers who 
backlog their orders increases exponentially as the waiting time for the next 
replenishment decreases. Shah and Shukla [2009] developed a deteriorating 
inventory model for waiting time partial backlogging when demand is constant 
and deterioration rate is constant. They made Abad [1996, 2001] more realistic 
and applicable in practice.  
In this paper, an inventory model for deteriorating items is developed with

time dependent demand and constant rate of deterioration. Shortages are allowed 
and partially backlogged; backlogging rate is variable and is dependent on the 
length of the next replenishment.    
 
 
2. Assumption and Notations 
 
The mathematical model is based on the following notations and assumptions. 
 
2.1 Notations 
• 
A    the ordering cost per order.  
• 
C    the purchase cost per unit.  
• 
θ     the deterioration rate. 
• 
h     the inventory carrying  cost per unit per time unit. 
• 
b
π     the backordered cost per unit short per time unit. 
• 
L
π     the cost of lost sales per unit. 
• 
1t      the time at which the inventory level reaches zero, 
1t ≥0 
• 
2t      the length of period during which shortages are allowed, 
2t ≥0 
• 
T      (= 1t + 2t ) the length of cycle time 
• 
IM     the maximum inventory level during [0, T]. 
• 
IB      the maximum inventory level during shortage period. 
• 
Q       (= IM + IB) the order quantity during a cycle of length T. 
• 
I1 (t)    the level of positive inventory at time t,

• 
I2 (t)    the level of negative inventory at time t,

• 
TC (t1,t2 ) the total cost per time unit. 
 
2.2 Assumptions  
• The demand rate is time dependent that is if ‘a’ is fix fraction of demand 
and ‘b’ is that fraction of demand which is vary with time then demand 
function is  f(t) = a + b t, where a>0 ,b>0. 
• Shortages are allowed and partially backlogged. 
• The lead time is zero. 
• The replenishment rate is infinite. 
• The planning horizon is infinite. 
• The deterioration rate is constant. 
• During stock out period, the backlogging rate is variable and is dependent 
on the length of the waiting time for next replenishment. So that the 
backlogging rate for negative inventory is, B (t) =

4.0 Analytical Solution 
 
Case I: Inventory level without shortage 
During the period [0, t1], the inventory depletes due to the deterioration and 
demand. Hence, the inventory level at any time during [0, t1] is described by 
differential equation

Case II: Inventory level with shortage 
During the interval [t1 ,T] the inventory level depends on demand and a 
fraction of demand is backlogged. The state of inventory during [t1 ,T] can be 
represented by the differential equation

5.0 Sensitivity Analysis 
 
Consider an inventory system with the following parameter in proper unit 
A=2500, h=.5, C=4, pib=12, pil=15, delta=8, a=25, b=20.0, theta=.005 .The 
computer output by using maple mathematical software is t1=5.4 t2=0.4 and TC= 
915.30. i.e. the value of t1 at which the inventory level become zero is 5.40 unit 
and shortage period is 0.04 unit .The variation in the parameter is as follows

From table 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 we observed that the total cost increases if we 
increases the parameter a,b , θ and δ .it’s also observed that the parameter a and b 
is more sensitive than the parameter θ and δ 
If we plot the total cost function (13) with some values of t1 and t2 s.t., t1= 5.0 to 
5.80 with equal interval t2 = 0.01 to.09.Then we get a three dimensional convex

6.0 Concluding Remarks 
 
In this paper, we developed a model for deteriorating item with time 
dependent demand and partial backlogging and give analytical solution of the 
model that minimize the total inventory cost. The deterioration factor taken into 
consideration in the present model, as almost all items undergo either direct 
spoilage (like fruits, vegetable etc) or physical decay (in case of radioactive 
substance etc.) in the course time, deterioration is natural feature in the inventory 
system. The model is very useful in the situation in which the demand rate is 
depending upon the time.

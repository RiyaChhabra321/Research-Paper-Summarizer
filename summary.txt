This 2010 paper presents a deterministic inventory model for deteriorating goods with time-dependent demand and partial backlogging.  The model accounts for a constant deterioration rate, a linear demand function, and a variable backlogging rate dependent on the time until the next replenishment.  The authors solve the model analytically to minimize total inventory cost, extending previous research by incorporating partial backlogging and a more realistic demand pattern.
